# GREPM - A WRAPPER FOR GREPMAIL UTILIZING MUTT

# grepm-0.5

# written 1998-11-xx by Moritz Barsnick <barsnick@gmx.net>
# updated 1998-12-22: added "-m" option for grepmail
#                     added "exit 1" to trap
# updated 1999-01-04: added check for empty "mailbox" (don't open mutt)
#                     added messages
#                     added umask (to keep others from reading your messages)
# updated 1999-01-19: added trap for SIGPIPE (any other suggestions?)
# updated 1999-07-05: added $TMPDIR; we're still subject to races ($TMPFILE
#                            might exist)
